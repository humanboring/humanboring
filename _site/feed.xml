Unfriended: Dark Web is the sequel to the 2014 film &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3713166/&quot;&gt;Unfriended&lt;/a&gt;. It shares the horror ‘gimmick’ of the whole film taking place inside a computer screen. The characters in our film are on a Skype call together, with our protagonist Mathias having stollen a laptop from a lost-and-found box. However, it turns out this computer belonged to a hacker, meaning our protagonists have become tangled in a larger game. Unlike the first film, there is almost no supernatural element to ‘Dark Web’, with the exception of the almost god-like hacking ability of the shadowy group terrorising the friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While very cheesy, this film was enjoyable throughout, though I watched it while drinking a beer with some friends so I’m not sure how fun it would be to watch alone. I would recommend this if you’re looking for a dump horror film to laugh at, but not so much if you actually want to be scared.&lt;/p&gt;

Incredibles 2 takes place immediately after the ending of the first film, even though the release was 14 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We follow the struggles of the Parr family in a world where ‘supers’ are illegal. Elasigirl, or Hellen Parr (the mother) is recruited to act as an example of what a super can be by Rick Dicker and his very &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autostraddle.com/for-a-movie-thats-not-gay-incredibles-2-sure-is-gay-425276/&quot;&gt;gay&lt;/a&gt; sister Evelyn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The animation looked great, as always in Pixar films, and the voice performances were strong. While not my favourite superhero film of 2018 (that would be Black Panther), it’s another strong Pixar film and definitely worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to go too much into what happens in the documentary, in part because most people know the basic story of the Fyre festival disaster. What I will say is the level of fraud and scam went much farther than I had previously realised, with the whole festival seeming much more like a con than a mistake. What was particularly shocking is the cockiness and arrogance of Billy McFarland. The fact he was still trying to plot new scams while already under investigation was shocking.&lt;/p&gt;

I watched Split as film 2 of 52 this year, and was fairly pleased. The cinematography was great, especially for a horror film. I enjoyed the setting also, with most of the film taking place in an underground complex (the location of which is revealed right at the end so I won’t spoil it). The actors all do a good job in this film, and in particular the two leads (James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy, the latter the star of the excellent 2015 film &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4263482/&quot;&gt;WITCH&lt;/a&gt;) did an excellent job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also address the presentation of mental illness in this film. Clearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder&quot;&gt;DID&lt;/a&gt; (or “split-personality”) in real life is nothing like how it appears in the film. One aspect (personality) cannot be allergic to bees while another is not, and different aspects can’t have differing strengths or abilities. However, I’m willing to overlook many of these issues, as this is clearly meant to be more of a fantastical rather than realistic film. The ending, however, felt like it was trying to be deeper and more meaningful than it actually was, and instead came across as cheesy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I enjoyed watching Split, even if it was kinda dumb at times. ★★★☆☆&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This review is pretty late, as my real life responsibilities got in the way a bit.

One important clarification is that by ‘new’ I mean a film that I haven’t already watched, not one that’s been newly released. The second half of this is that I’ll be writing a brief review / my thoughts on the film I watched here. This should mean weekly posts, though some will be delayed (As you might notice, there was no post for the first week of 2019).&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll follow-up with another post afterwards grading my own predictions, and seeing if I beat my previous score (2 correct predictions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iPhones
Based on reading various rumours, it seems like a number of new iPhones will be announced next week: A follow up to the iPhone X (maybe called the X s), a larger version of the X, and a 6.1” cheaper iPhone with a similar design to the X. There are also some hints that there might be a replacement to the 7 of some kind. My predictions for the new line-up are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPhone X s (5.8”) and X s plus (6.5”) with a new gold colour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPhone 9 (6.1” with an X-like design, aluminium frame, a range of colours)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPhone 8 and 8 plus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New replacement for the 7 (possibly using the SE name).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Watch
The Apple Watch series 4 is expected to be announced a this event. Thanks to a leak published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2018/08/30/exclusive-apple-watch-series-4/&quot;&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/a&gt; we know they will feature a new design, with the screen taking up more of the face, a tweaked Digital Crown and side button, and a thinner profile. My predictions for the watch are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New designs with larger screens but similar x and y dimensions of previous models. Old bands still work. No new colours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More complications available only on the newer models.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Series 3 becomes cheaper, 4g option exclusive to Series 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-there-will-be-no-7s-&quot;&gt;1. There will be no 7s ✅&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got that right (mostly). The new “normal” iPhones were in fact called the 8 and 8 plus. However, I was wrong about the name of the new, top of the line model. This is infact the iPhone X [^1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-edition-will-be-a-taste-from-the-future-&quot;&gt;2. The Edition will be a ‘taste from the future’ ❌&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have to see about whether the X line continues onto next year, but there was no real justification for this newest, top of the line model above the new design and features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-the-edition-will-be-very-expensive-&quot;&gt;3. The Edition will be very expensive ✅&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price I predicted was pretty much dead on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;total-score-23&quot;&gt;Total score: 2/3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad for a first attempt, though I’ll make a slightly more extensive list of predictions in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[^1] Which is pronounced “10” for some strange reason.

I’ll get a couple of predictions out here so I can say I told you so or face the shame of being wrong online. I’ll be watching the event, and follow up with my score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-there-will-be-no-7s&quot;&gt;1. There will be no 7s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current rumours are saying that all models will have glass backs, possibly with wireless charging. If the iPhone 7 got a new number, despite looking similar to the 6 in nearly every way, you can bet that models with new materials will get a new number too. My official name predictions: iPhone 8, iPhone 8 plus, iPhone Edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-edition-will-be-a-taste-from-the-future&quot;&gt;2. The Edition will be a ‘taste from the future’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third model (Edition), with the front of the device nearly totally covered in screen, will be presented as a way to get the future of the iPhone early. I’m also predicting that this is a one-off event, with the line-up dropping back to 2 models next year. They’ll have very similar designs to this year’s Edition, with a plus-sized model in a similar design available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-the-edition-will-be-very-expensive&quot;&gt;3. The Edition will be very expensive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this model is sitting above the 8 and 8 plus in price (which it will), it’s going to be a very expensive phone. I’m predicting a starting price of $999, though I would expect a large amount of storage included with this. Premium phone, premium price.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">All of the rumours so far have suggested that we’re going to see three iPhones announced at the event next week: two that look somewhat similar to the 7 and 7 plus, as well as another futuristic model.
