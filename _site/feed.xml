This horror film focusses on a family on holiday in Santa Cruz. When the mother (Adelaide, played by Lupita Nyong’o) was a child, she had visited this beach. After wondering off on her own, she entered a hall of mirrors and met a girl who looked exactly like her, an even that scarred her. While the family is staying in the same area in the present day, Adelaide and her family are terrorised by people that look exactly like them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved this film; the acting from the main cast, the lighting and camera work, and the soundtrack were all very strong. The story all made sense as you watch it but left me and my partner discussing what exactly was going in and why things happened as they did for hours after watching it. It reminded me of ‘The Shining’ in some ways, perhaps deliberately. There was use of Native American imagery throughout, and one character limping while carrying a weapon was reminiscent to Jack Torrence at the end of ‘The Shining’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Us’ is a film I want to watch again to attempt to answer some of the questions it left me, and to look at certain scenes with the knowledge I have now. It’s definitely worth watching if you like horror films.

Firstly the animation is spectacular - if you haven’t already go an watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg52up16eq0&quot;&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt; and see for yourself how spectacular this film is. The only recent film with a style rivalling Spider-Verse was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/&quot;&gt;Blade-Runner: 2049&lt;/a&gt; (my favourite film of 2017).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film follows Miles Morales, a young black and latino teen living in Brooklyn who gets bitten by a radioactive spider, granting him all the powers of Spider-Man. He stubles across a supercollider that is threatening Brooklyn with distruction while also bringing other Spider-people into Miles’s universe. The casting of Jake Johnson as Peter Parker helps bring what is probably my favourite big-screen version of Parker to life. Johnson’s Spider-Man is an older, well-established hero, but has become slightly jaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spider-Verse is one of the best superhero films in years, reminding me of the early Sam Rami films in their optimism and presentation Spider-Man of a true hero for people to look up to.

Unfriended: Dark Web is the sequel to the 2014 film &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3713166/&quot;&gt;Unfriended&lt;/a&gt;. It shares the horror ‘gimmick’ of the whole film taking place inside a computer screen. The characters in our film are on a Skype call together, with our protagonist Mathias having stollen a laptop from a lost-and-found box. However, it turns out this computer belonged to a hacker, meaning our protagonists have become tangled in a larger game. Unlike the first film, there is almost no supernatural element to ‘Dark Web’, with the exception of the almost god-like hacking ability of the shadowy group terrorising the friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While very cheesy, this film was enjoyable throughout, though I watched it while drinking a beer with some friends so I’m not sure how fun it would be to watch alone. I would recommend this if you’re looking for a dump horror film to laugh at, but not so much if you actually want to be scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We follow the struggles of the Parr family in a world where ‘supers’ are illegal. Elasigirl, or Hellen Parr (the mother) is recruited to act as an example of what a super can be by Rick Dicker and his very &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autostraddle.com/for-a-movie-thats-not-gay-incredibles-2-sure-is-gay-425276/&quot;&gt;gay&lt;/a&gt; sister Evelyn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The animation looked great, as always in Pixar films, and the voice performances were strong. While not my favourite superhero film of 2018 (that would be Black Panther), it’s another strong Pixar film and definitely worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to go too much into what happens in the documentary, in part because most people know the basic story of the Fyre festival disaster. What I will say is the level of fraud and scam went much farther than I had previously realised, with the whole festival seeming much more like a con than a mistake. What was particularly shocking is the cockiness and arrogance of Billy McFarland. The fact he was still trying to plot new scams while already under investigation was shocking.&lt;/p&gt;

I watched Split as film 2 of 52 this year, and was fairly pleased. The cinematography was great, especially for a horror film. I enjoyed the setting also, with most of the film taking place in an underground complex (the location of which is revealed right at the end so I won’t spoil it). The actors all do a good job in this film, and in particular the two leads (James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy, the latter the star of the excellent 2015 film &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4263482/&quot;&gt;WITCH&lt;/a&gt;) did an excellent job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also address the presentation of mental illness in this film. Clearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder&quot;&gt;DID&lt;/a&gt; (or “split-personality”) in real life is nothing like how it appears in the film. One aspect (personality) cannot be allergic to bees while another is not, and different aspects can’t have differing strengths or abilities. However, I’m willing to overlook many of these issues, as this is clearly meant to be more of a fantastical rather than realistic film. The ending, however, felt like it was trying to be deeper and more meaningful than it actually was, and instead came across as cheesy.&lt;/p&gt;

One important clarification is that by ‘new’ I mean a film that I haven’t already watched, not one that’s been newly released. The second half of this is that I’ll be writing a brief review / my thoughts on the film I watched here. This should mean weekly posts, though some will be delayed (As you might notice, there was no post for the first week of 2019).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iPhones
Based on reading various rumours, it seems like a number of new iPhones will be announced next week: A follow up to the iPhone X (maybe called the X s), a larger version of the X, and a 6.1” cheaper iPhone with a similar design to the X. There are also some hints that there might be a replacement to the 7 of some kind. My predictions for the new line-up are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPhone X s (5.8”) and X s plus (6.5”) with a new gold colour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPhone 9 (6.1” with an X-like design, aluminium frame, a range of colours)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPhone 8 and 8 plus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New replacement for the 7 (possibly using the SE name).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Watch
The Apple Watch series 4 is expected to be announced a this event. Thanks to a leak published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2018/08/30/exclusive-apple-watch-series-4/&quot;&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/a&gt; we know they will feature a new design, with the screen taking up more of the face, a tweaked Digital Crown and side button, and a thinner profile. My predictions for the watch are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New designs with larger screens but similar x and y dimensions of previous models. Old bands still work. No new colours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More complications available only on the newer models.&lt;/li&gt;
