This is the new home for my occasional blog posts. I will be gradually adding in my archives from Medium and my previous site as time goes on, as well as adding in some new posts in the future.

For more information on me, check out my [homepage](https://www.bhp.org.uk), my [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/bhp_uk), or my [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/qakgob). You can also subscribe to my [RSS](https://www.humanboring.net/feed.xml).

This webpage is a lightly modified version of the Jekyll theme [Athena](https://github.com/broccolini/athena), so many thanks to [Diana Mounter](https://github.com/broccolini) for making it.
